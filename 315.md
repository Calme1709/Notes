## Potential (Volt)
The brightness of light in optical fibre.
The voltage in an electric conductor.
The level of water in a tank.

## Voltage (Volt)
Can be thought of as the water pressure in a tank

## Current (Ampere)
Can be thought of as the amount of water that flows between the two tanks (litres per second)

## Electromagnetic Fields
An electrical current running through a conductor creates a magnetic field around the conductor, the strength of this field is relative to the inverse of the distance from the conductor.

If the current changes the magnetic field will as well

A changing magnetic field induces an electrical current, this is harnessed and useful in generators, transformers, and radio communication

## Power (Watt)
Water that flows through a device such as a turbine can do work for us, e.g. generate energy. In physics the ability to perform work and energy are the same.

To perform work we need both water pressure (voltage) and water flow (current).

Current can only perform work if driven by pressure.

The amount of energy that can be created in a given amount of time is proportional to the square of the water pressure.

The amount of energy that can be transferred between systems per second is known as power and is measured in watts.

Communication involves a transmitter transferring (often small) amounts of energy to the receiver in order to perform work at the receiver that changes the receiver’s state.


## Properties of waves
#### Amplitude
The difference in potential (e.g., voltage) between the peak of the waveform and its average potential. The power of a signal is proportional to the square of its amplitude.

#### Frequency
Number of peaks of the waveform per second.

F = 1 / T where T is cycle time

#### Phase
Delay between the first rise in a waveform and the start of the reference time. Can be expressed as an angle where 360deg is one cycle.

#### DC Offset
Difference between average potential and nominal zero potential.

#### Wavelength
The distance the signal travels over one cycle time.
λ = cT where c is propagation time and T is cycle time.
λ = c(1/F) where c is propagation time and F is frequency.

## Types of Signals
### Analog
In communication, we often use analog signals that are limited in amplitude (certain minimal and maximal voltages and/or currents are not exceeded) and that alternate between positive and negative voltages/currents

Such signals may be thought of as the superposition (sum) of sinusoidal signals.

#### Uses:
- Conventional Telephone
- Old mobile phones
- Conventional Radio and TV

#### Advantages / Disadvantages
- Does not necessarily require a computer or digital logic.
- Analog signal communication cannot separate signal from noise.

### Digital Signals
Ideally have only two states (0, 1)

Can be expressed as voltage levels or light intensities, however can also be expressed as combinations of amplitude and phase in an analog signal.

Transitions between states are theoretically instantaneous (never in an in between state), however this is not actually possible.

#### Uses:
- Most mobile phones
- Digital Radio/TV

#### Advantages / Disadvantages
- Can to an extent separate signal from noise.
- Does require a computer or digital logic.

## Transmission Mediums
### Electrical Conductors
Generally made of copper.

#### Coaxial
Is the traditional cable form for data communication.

##### Physical Makeup
- Inner conductor made of copper
- Plastic or foam between inner core and shield.
- Shield is copper mesh and/or tinfoil.
- Outside insulation.

Ratio of diameters is important for impedance.
Larger the overall diameter the lower the signal degradation
Signal travels through inner conductor, outer conductor is grounded to stop radiation and interfering signals

##### Disadvantages
- Expensive
- Data rate over long distance is much lower than optical fibre

##### Uses
- Applications where antenna and receiver are some distance apart (domestic TV, broadcasting).
- Early Ethernet.

#### Twinaxial


#### Twisted Pair
Present day standard for Ethernet.

Contains multiple pairs of simple insulated copper wires twisted together.
Each wire in a pair carries complementary signals cancelling each other out.
Can be shielded (e.g. STP) or just insulated (e.g. UTP)

Communication with twisted pair uses current rather than voltage.

Very low susceptibility to outside signals

#### Power Line
### Optical Fibre
Made from glass or plastic
Cheap
Can be run for up to several hundred km with amplifiers
More difficult to connect than copper wiring.
Widely deployed but still an emerging technology.
Data rates over 1Tb/s currently possible.

Contains two cores, inner core and outer core.

The outer core has a lower refractive index (i.e., light moves faster there) than the inner core. This means that light in the inner core is “trapped” by refraction.

Refraction is also the means of transport when the inner/outer core are replaced by a “graded refractive index”, i.e., when the glass gets “faster” as the light moves away from the center.

#### Multi-mode
We can send more than one light ray down a fibre by choosing different angles of incidence at the start.

Multi-mode fibres are usually often for short distances only because it gets a bit difficult to keep the rays apart.Graded-index fibre is best for this job.

Another way to put more information through a fibre is to send light in different colours (wavelength multiplexing).

Used in most and long distance cables because it’s so cheap

When cables are laid, they usually contain several pairs of fibres (fibres typically come in pairs – one fibre for each direction of communication)

Anything over a couple of 100 km needs repeaters, which are very expensive

### Air (Radio, Laser, Smoke Signals)
Traditionally used for overland phone circuits and radio/TV.

Also used by satellites and anything that has to move.

Increasingly used in low power/short range digital applications (Cellphones, Bluetooth, 802.11 WiFi, 3G/4G, etc).

### Friis inverse square law
In free space received power drops to a quarter when the distance doubles.

Received voltage drops to half when the distance doubles.

### How to increase signal power
Transmit more power - often expensive or prohibited by other requirements (weight for satellites etc)

Transmit towards the receiver.

Use a receiver antenna that collects more of the transmitted power.

The ability of an antenna to be able to bundle or harvest signal power is known as its gain.

Use coding to recover information by statistical means, this is often slower.

## Signal Propagation
Signals in cable (electrical or optical fibre) tend to propagate at 2e8, approx 2/3 of 3e8 which is the speed of light.

The power we feed into a cable gets reduced by a constant factor (A < 1) per unit of cable length (attenuation):
- If we change input power by a certain factor, output power changes by the same factor
- Cable of length L attenuates the input power by a factor of a^L

The value of a depends on the cables construction and also the frequency of the signal.

a is often expressed in decibels.

## Decibels
Used to express voltage and power ratios.

power: dB = 10 log10(p1 / p2)
voltage: dB = 20 log10(v1 / v2)

Power ratio of 1:2 is approx 3dB
Power ratio of 1:10 is 10dB

Voltage ratio of 1:2 is approx 6dB
voltage ratio of 1:10 is 20dB

### dBm
30 dBm = 30dB + 1mW = 10^3 * 1mW = 1W.
-30dBm = -30dB + 1mW = 10^-3 * 1mW = 1E-3mW
30 dBW = 30dB + 1W = 10^3 * 1W = 1000W.

## Satellites

### Geostationary/Geosynchronous (GEO)
High circular orbit in the equatorial plane 35,786 km above the equator.
Orbit the earth exactly once every sidereal day
Appears to stay at the same spot in the sky at all times, easy to point a receiver at.

Can service a little less than one hemisphere but can do 24/7.

High orbit requires large rocket and lots of fuel, therefore satellite usually limited in weight, and therefore lower solar cells, less battery capacity, etc.

Needs maneuvering to ensure it stays in the correct orbit.

Most communication satellites used to be geostationary.
High latency (minimum ~250ms) between ground stations.
Path loss is high.

#### Uses
- TV Satellites and direct to site internet satellites
- Communication satellites (phone and internet)
- Special purpose satellites (e.g. weather satellites)

### Medium Earth Orbit Satellites (MEO)
Typical altitude of several thousand km.

Move around in the sky.
- Need multiple satellites to provide 24/7 cover.
- Can cover more territory.
- Antennas tend to be smaller than GEO satellites however they must move to track the satellites in the sky.
  
Can have an inclination (angle between orbital plane and equatorial plane) which determines the highest/lowest latitude than the satellite can cover.

Commonly used for GPS (and its international counterparts).
Used for communication as it can service a large area with lower latencies than GEO

### Low Earth Orbit Satellites (LEO)
Low (relative) orbit typically several hundred km

Move quickly across the sky, need many satellites to provide 24/7 cover.

Antennas smaller but need to be steering.

Cheaper to launch but get dragged down by the earths atmosphere.

Significant inclination (up to 90deg)

#### Uses
- Earth observation (Spying)
- Communication
- ISS

Serves a small area for a short amount of time.

Low latency, low (relative) path loss.
Can be larger.
